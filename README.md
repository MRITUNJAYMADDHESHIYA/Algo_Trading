Algo-trading, is a method of executing trades using pre-programmed instructions that account for various factors like price, timing, and volume. These algorithms can rapidly analyze market data and execute orders faster and more efficiently than human traders. 

I am working on Many Trading-Bot in Python, MQL(MetaQuotes Language), c++ and This is a dominant force in financial markets, with the majority of trading volume in some markets attributed to algorithmic strategies.
# Algorithmic Trading Projects

This repository showcases my work in algorithmic trading, leveraging different programming languages to build, backtest, and deploy trading strategies.

## MQL for MetaTrader
MQL (MetaQuotes Language) is a specialized language designed for developing trading robots and technical indicators on MetaTrader platforms. My MQL projects focus on automating trading strategies, creating custom indicators, and optimizing performance using MetaTrader 4/5. These scripts and expert advisors (EAs) are built to execute trades based on predefined criteria, manage risk, and analyze market conditions.

## Python Projects
Python is a versatile language widely used in the financial industry for backtesting strategies, data analysis, and machine learning applications. My Python projects include implementing and testing trading algorithms, developing custom tools for market analysis, and integrating machine learning models to enhance decision-making processes.

## C++ Projects
C++ is known for its high performance, making it ideal for low-latency trading systems and high-frequency trading (HFT) applications.
